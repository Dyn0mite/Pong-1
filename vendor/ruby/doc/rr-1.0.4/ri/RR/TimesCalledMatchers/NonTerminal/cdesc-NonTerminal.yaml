- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Including this module marks the TimesCalledMatcher as NonTerminal. Being NonTerminal means the Double will not &quot;terminate&quot; even when called infinite times.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The Double that uses a NonTerminal TimesCalledMatcher will continue using the Double when passed the matching arguments. This is done by the attempt? always returning true.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is in opposition to Terminal TimesCalledMatchers, where attempt? will eventually return false.
