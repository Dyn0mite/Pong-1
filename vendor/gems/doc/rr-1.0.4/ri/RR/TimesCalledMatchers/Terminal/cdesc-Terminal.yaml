- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Including this module marks the TimesCalledMatcher as Terminal. Being Terminal the Double will &quot;terminate&quot; when times called is finite.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The Double that uses a Terminal TimesCalledMatcher will eventually be passed over to the next Double when passed the matching arguments enough times. This is done by the attempt? method returning false when executed a finite number of times.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is in opposition to NonTerminal TimesCalledMatchers, where attempt? will always return true.
